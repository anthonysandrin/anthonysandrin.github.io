Yoffee is a coffee machine that harnesses the power of [Yo](http://justyo.co).
Just send your coffee machine a [Yo](http://justyo.co) and it will send you
back a [Yo](http://justyo.co) when the coffee is done. It was created in 24
hours at HackMIT 2014. The project was created in a group of four where I was
responsible for using python to develop the software that interacted with
[Yo](http://justyo.co) and alerted the machine when it was time to make
coffee.
